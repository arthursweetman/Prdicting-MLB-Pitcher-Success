# Prdicting-MLB-Pitcher-Success
Perform a Multiple Linear Regression Analysis in order to predict the success of a MLB pitcher

## Overview
This was my final project when taking Linear Regression during the Spring Semester of my Sophomore year at Miami University. Although there is only one code file, I encourage you, the reader of this, to look at all the files in this repository (except for maybe `all.Rda`, the file that includes the data I worked with). `eda.R` is where I did all my computations and data analysis. `report.docx` and `presentation.zip` are the final products of my analysis.  I highly encourage you to:
1. Watch `presentation.mp4`, located inside `presentation.zip`.
2. Read through `report.docx`, my written report of my analysis.
3. Take a look and my data analysis techniques used in `eda.R`.

Note that you have to first download `report.docx` and `presentation.zip` in order to view their contents.
